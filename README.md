## ðŸš€ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/your-username/human_loop_ai_project.git
cd human_loop_ai_project

### 2. Install Dependencies

cd agent
npm install

cd ../supervisor-ui
npm install

### 3. Configure Firebase
Create a Firebase project.

Enable Firestore.

Download the service account JSON and place it in:
agent/firebase-service-account.json

### 4. Configure LiveKit
Manually generate a LiveKit access token or use token_generator/.

Replace the token in agent.js:

const ACCESS_TOKEN = 'your_livekit_token';

### 5. Run the Project
## Start the AI Agent

cd agent
node agent.js

## Start the API Server (to serve learned answers)

cd ../supervisor-ui
npm start

### ðŸ’¡ Knowledge Base Format

{
  "business_info": "We are a full-service salon in Downtown LA.",
  "faqs": {
    "what are your hours": "We're open daily 9am to 7pm.",
    "do you offer bridal makeup?": {
      "answer": "Yes, we do provide bridal makeup.",
      "source": "learned"
    }
  }
}

###  Sample Workflow :

1.AI Agent connects to LiveKit and greets user.
2.Captures name + phone to generate customerId.
3.Handles known FAQs, escalates unknowns.
4.Supervisor UI sees the pending request.
5.Supervisor responds â†’ AI follows up live.
6.Answer is learned for future use.


### Design Highlights
-Real-time sync using Firestore listeners.
-Session-based AI agent (like a real phone call).
-Timeout logic to mark unresolved requests.
-Simple admin UI for scalability
